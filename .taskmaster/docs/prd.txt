# Syslog MCP Server - Product Requirements Document

## Overview  
The Syslog MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes syslog data collected from multiple devices via Elasticsearch to AI assistants and other MCP clients. It solves the problem of making log analysis accessible to LLMs, enabling natural language queries, pattern recognition, and automated troubleshooting insights. The target users are system administrators, DevOps engineers, and IT support teams who need intelligent log analysis capabilities.

## Core Features  

### Log Search and Filtering
- **What it does**: Enables natural language and structured queries against syslog data stored in Elasticsearch
- **Why it's important**: Transforms complex Elasticsearch queries into simple, accessible searches
- **How it works**: Exposes FastMCP tools that translate user requests into optimized ES queries with filters for device, log level, time range, and custom patterns

### Device Management and Status
- **What it does**: Provides visibility into all devices sending logs and their current health status
- **Why it's important**: Gives administrators a centralized view of infrastructure health
- **How it works**: Aggregates device information from logs, tracks activity patterns, and generates health reports

### AI-Powered Log Analysis  
- **What it does**: Leverages client LLMs to analyze log patterns, identify root causes, and suggest solutions
- **Why it's important**: Transforms raw logs into actionable insights without requiring deep log analysis expertise
- **How it works**: Uses FastMCP's context sampling to send log excerpts to client LLMs for pattern analysis

### Real-time Progress Reporting
- **What it does**: Shows progress for long-running operations like large log searches or bulk analysis
- **Why it's important**: Provides user feedback during potentially slow Elasticsearch operations
- **How it works**: Uses FastMCP's progress reporting to update clients during multi-stage operations

### Resource-based Data Access
- **What it does**: Exposes static and dynamic log data through URI-based resource endpoints
- **Why it's important**: Allows clients to access structured log data and statistics programmatically
- **How it works**: FastMCP resources provide endpoints like `logs://{device}/recent` and `stats://summary`

## User Experience  

### User Personas
- **Primary**: System Administrator - needs quick access to error logs and system health
- **Secondary**: DevOps Engineer - requires detailed analysis for incident response
- **Tertiary**: Support Engineer - needs guided troubleshooting assistance

### Key User Flows
1. **Quick Error Check**: "Show me errors from web-server-01 in the last hour"
2. **Pattern Analysis**: "Analyze these database connection errors and suggest fixes"  
3. **Device Health**: "What's the status of all my servers?"
4. **Incident Investigation**: Multi-step deep dive with AI assistance

### UI/UX Considerations
- Natural language queries through MCP client (Claude, etc.)
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Structured data presentation with AI insights
- Error handling with helpful context

## Technical Architecture  

### System Components
- **FastMCP Server**: Core MCP server using HTTP transport (stateful for performance)
- **Elasticsearch Client**: Async ES client for log queries and aggregations  
- **Authentication Layer**: Optional bearer token auth for secure deployments
- **Middleware Stack**: Logging, timing, and error handling middleware
- **Context Management**: State management for caching and session data

### Data Models
- **Log Entry**: timestamp, device, level, message, metadata
- **Device Status**: name, last_seen, error_count, health_score
- **Search Query**: filters, time_range, pagination, aggregations
- **Analysis Result**: patterns, insights, recommendations

### APIs and Integrations
- **MCP Tools**: search_logs, analyze_errors, device_health, bulk_analysis
- **MCP Resources**: device_list, recent_logs, error_patterns, health_dashboard  
- **MCP Prompts**: log_analysis_template, troubleshooting_guide
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and search backend (existing)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Runtime**: Python 3.8+ with asyncio support
- **Dependencies**: fastmcp, elasticsearch-async, pydantic
- **Network**: HTTP access to Elasticsearch cluster
- **Memory**: Moderate (for caching frequently accessed data)
- **Storage**: None (reads from existing ES)
