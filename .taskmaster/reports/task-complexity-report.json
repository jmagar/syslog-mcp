			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization into separate concerns: Python environment setup, dependency management, project structure creation, configuration files, and basic logging setup. Each subtask should be independently verifiable and follow Python packaging best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple setup components that need coordination. Standard Python project initialization with some FastMCP-specific requirements. Well-established patterns make this straightforward but requires attention to detail for proper foundation."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Elasticsearch Connection and Health Check",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into connection management, authentication handling, health monitoring, retry logic, connection pooling, and comprehensive error handling. Focus on async patterns, proper resource management, and production-ready resilience features.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to async patterns, connection management, retry logic, and comprehensive error handling. Requires deep understanding of Elasticsearch client, async context managers, and production reliability patterns like circuit breakers."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Core Data Models and Schema Validation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create separate model groups: log entry models, device models, query/search models, result models, custom validators, and serialization handling. Each model group should have comprehensive validation and proper type safety.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multiple interconnected models requiring proper validation, datetime handling, and custom validators. Pydantic expertise needed for advanced validation patterns and timezone handling."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Search with Aggregations",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into aggregation types: statistical aggregations, time-based patterns, complex query building, saved searches, composite aggregations, query optimization, and performance tuning. Each aggregation type needs specific implementation and testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to advanced Elasticsearch features, complex query building, performance optimization requirements, and multiple aggregation types. Requires deep Elasticsearch expertise and performance tuning knowledge."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into structured logging setup, custom exception hierarchy, circuit breaker implementation, error recovery mechanisms, performance metrics collection, and middleware integration. Each component should handle specific failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring comprehensive error handling patterns, circuit breaker implementation, structured logging with JSON formatting, and production monitoring. Critical for system reliability and requires deep async error handling knowledge."
